# Description
This repo contains my attempts at Backbone.js quizzes from the
Udacity Frontend Nanodegree program. The quizzes test our
understanding of what's happening in Backbone's source code
by requiring us to create custom functionality similar to 2
key aspects of Backbone's engine:
- the templating functionality, and
- the events tracking system

## Installing
Perform a simple
```
git clone <github-repo-url>
```
to get the files locally (`<github-repo-url>` depends on if you fork
this repo or use this one). Simply open the index file in your browser
to see the tests passing. âœ…ðŸ˜ƒ

## Notes
- [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) is used for testing but does not require any extra setup
because it's loaded from a CDN in the `index.html` file.
- I will not be accepting pull requests for this repo.
- Perhaps unwisely, I replaced the code from the first quiz on
building a custom templating function with the code for the next
quiz on the event tracking system. Thankfully, the code from the
first quiz is part of the commit history. See [the first commit](https://github.com/CodeWithOz/UdacityBackboneQuizzes/blob/2fb20eadadb6b892694720fe888bcabe0fca1dc4/template.js).
